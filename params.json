{"name":"Educator Productivity Toolkit (v0.1b)","tagline":"A productivity toolkit for those in the field of education.","body":"# Educator Productivity Toolkit\r\n\r\nA productivity tool for instructors.     \r\nUsers will have the ability to:\r\n - read/write data for a class;\r\n - perform analytics on class and individual student performance;\r\n - email reports, gradebook, and other materials\r\n \r\n## 1. Setup Instructions\r\n\r\nTo build the updated project, add the following dependencies (JAR files) in a directory. For example:\r\n - Create a folder called \"projectDependencies\"\r\n - In this folder, include mail.jar: \r\n   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-eeplat-419426.html#javamail-1.4.5-oth-JPR\r\n - Navigate to: File > Project Structure > Modules > Dependencies\r\n - Click the green + icon and select \"JARs or directories...\"\r\n - Navigate to and select your directory \"projectDependencies\"\r\n - Click \"Apply\" then \"OK\"\r\n - The libraries should now be included in the project. See my previous emails for details on how to build a project JAR or     compile to run. \r\n\r\n# 2. Installing Git: \r\n- Go to the site and download: https://git-scm.com/download/win\r\n- During configuration, select both Git Bash and Git GUI\r\n- Select \"Use with Windows Command Prompt\"\r\n\r\n## 3. Installing IntelliJ:\r\n- Go to the site, make an account using your Texas State email, and download:\r\nhttps://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Basics+and+Installation\r\n- Take most default options but look through some of the settings and remove components that are not commonly used to speed up load times. Web servers like Glassfish, Tomcat; version control plugins: we will be using Git and GitHub;\r\n- From the main menu, click on \"View\" and check all four options (Toolbar, Tool Buttons, Status Bar, Navigation Bar)\r\n- Ctrl+Shift+A for looking up commands; Ctrl+Shift+F for global searches\r\n\r\n## 4. Working with GitHub:\r\n- Make an account: https://github.com/\r\n- Send me your user name so I can add you to the project\r\n- Download the code as a zip and extract it somewhere\r\n\r\n## 5. Configuring the project to compile and run:\r\nNote that there is some duplication with #1 above as both steps reference including mail.jar\r\n\r\n- Select a project SDK (usually located in Program Files > Java > jdk###). IntelliJ I believe comes with one but if you don't find it, you can download a jdk from Oracle. I recommend version 1.6 something. \r\n- Download the latest mail.jar from Oracle: \r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-eeplat-419426.html#javamail-1.4.5-oth-JPR\r\n- Extract just mail.jar from the zip to some location\r\n- In IntelliJ, select \"Open Project,\" then \"from existing sources\" (just follow the prompts until you can select the folder)\r\n- When you are prompted with selecting the project source, navigate to the workflowProcess-master folder. Select it\r\n- Finish opening the project, go to File > Project Structure > Modules > Dependencies\r\n- Click the + icon, then select 1. Jar or directories\r\n- find mail.jar and add is as a dependency to the project\r\n- Go back to File > Project Structure; then select Artifacts\r\n- Click the + icon, hover over JAR, then \"From modules with dependencies\"\r\n- To build the project JAR, on the main menu, select Build > Build Artifacts; a little popup will open, select \"Build\"\r\n- You should now have an \"out\" directory with two sub-folders - artifacts and production. \r\n- Finally, to compile and run the application for the first time, select the \"Main\" class\r\n- Right click, Run Main (or Ctrl + Shift + F10)\r\n\r\n## 6. Marking directories in IntelliJ\r\n- When you build a JAR for the project, the \"out\" directory should be automatically set to ignore\r\n- right click on \".idea\" directory, select \"Mark directory as,\" then select \"Excluded\"\r\n- the \"src\" directory should be automatically marked as source when you create the project\r\n- the \"test\" directory should be marked as test: right click > mark directory as > test\r\n- the file \"educatorProductivityToolkit-master.iml\" should be automatically ignored\r\n- the file \"MANIFEST.MF\" should be ignored; it is used for packaging the app as a JAR\r\n- Colors in IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/file-status-highlights.html):\r\n    - red: ignored by Git\r\n    - blue: the file has been modified from it's current version / a change has been made\r\n    - green: a new file is added\r\n    - brown: file exists locally, but is not in the repository, and is not scheduled for adding. \r\n\r\nAs the project directory structure changes and we add things like packages, other dependencies, we may need to go through this process a few times.\r\nIf we are mostly working remote, we can look into meeting tools like Cisco WebEx or Skype so we can share the desktop and get on a call together.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
